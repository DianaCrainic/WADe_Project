                            The cryk (cryptocurrency knowledge manager) application represents a modular Web system
                            capable to express and manage the knowledge about existing cryptocurrencies and their
                            (meta-)data. Each functionality will be implemented by a (micro-)service and
                            all queries will be performed via a SPARQL endpoint. Exposed information will be available
                            in multiple formats (e.g. HTML+RDFa and JSON-LD). Moreover, multiple visualizations of
                            interest will be provided.

                            Nowadays, cryptocurrency domain is attracting a lot of interest. Cryptocurrency is a
                            decentralized digital currency stored in an online form that does not fall under governments
                            and banks control, which was proposed in an attempt to replace the fiat currency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Among thousands of cryptocurrencies, it can be overwhelming to decide which crypto to invest
                            in. More often than not, people miss the important details and end up mismanaging their
                            crypto investments. And that's especially true for serious investors with
                            a widely spread-out portfolio.

                        <p>
                            The application architecture is based on microservices, with two microservices:
                            <i><b>Cryptocurrencies service</b></i> and <i><b>News service</b></i>.
                        <ol>
                            <li><i><b>Cryptocurrencies service</b></i> is a service whose responsibility is to manage
                                cryptocurrencies. It consists of an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS
                                    Lambda</a> function that performs various SPARQL queries (e.g. <code>SELECT</code>,
                                <code>INSERT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>) on an <a
                                    href="https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/">Amazon Neptune</a> database. The database
                                contains RDF triples that model knowledge about existing cryptocurrencies and their
                                (meta-)data. These RDF triples are loaded into the database through <a
                                    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load.html">Amazon
                                    Neptune Bulk Loader</a> (an external file uploaded to an <a
                                    href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> bucket will be loaded). Both the
                                lambda function and the database runs within the same VPC (security reasons).
                            </li>

                            <li><i><b>News service</b></i> is a service whose responsibility is to manage news about
                                cryptocurrencies. It consists of an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS
                                    Lambda</a> function that performs various SPARQL queries (e.g. <code>SELECT</code>,
                                <code>INSERT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>) on an <a
                                    href="https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/">Amazon Neptune</a> database, like
                                <i><b>Cryptocurrencies service</b></i>. The database contains RDF triples that model
                                knowledge about crypto news. Both the lambda function and the database runs within the
                                same VPC (security reasons).
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>The execution of the lambda functions associated with the microservices is triggered by
                            calling the GraphQL API provided by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/">AWS
                                AppSync</a>. Depending on the query or mutation that was called, the lambda function of
                            the corresponding microservice will be executed. See <a
                                href="https://github.com/DianaCrainic/WADe_Project/wiki/GraphQL-API#schema">GraphQL API:
                                Schema</a> for the schema structure of the GraphQL API.</p>

                        <p>A React client will call the GraphQL API and display the received data in a Single Page
                            Application. An <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> bucket is used to store
                            the static files built from the React application.
                            The bucket is enabled for static hosting and is made public so the files can be accessed by
                            the website endpoint. The website is served through an <a
                                href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a> distribution
                            (a content delivery network (CDN) service built for high performance, security, and
                            developer convenience).</p>

                        <p>The access to the application's features is controlled using <a
                                href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a>. See <a

                            query Neptune using <strong>SPARQL</strong> and receive the result as <strong>RDF</strong>
                            and/or <strong>JSON</strong>. The front-end sends <strong>JSON</strong> with a GraphQL query
                            to AWS AppSync. AppSync then sends the query further, to the corresponding lambda of the
                            operation. The lambda sends back to the client <strong>JSON(-LD)</strong>. The webpage
                            presents to the user data in <strong>JSON-LD</strong>, <strong>RDFa</strong> formats and
                            allows them to export it as a <em>.csv</em> file.

                    <ol>
                        <li>Use URIs as names for things.</li>
                        <li>Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.</li>
                        <li>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF, SPARQL).
                        </li>
                        <li>Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.</li>
                    </ol>
                    are meant to implement the Semantic Web, which revolves around creating links, so that a person or
                    machine can explore the web of data.

                        To evaluate the data openness and essentially whether these principles are followed closely or
                        not, a star rating has been designed, known as 5 &starf; Open Data. It is comprised of 5 quality
                        levels, rewarding from 1 to 5 stars based on how open, public,
                        easy to use and rich in context is the data offered.

                        The <b>cryk (cryptocurrency knowledge manager)</b> application, a modular web system aimed to
                        express and manage knowledge about existing cryptocurrencies and
                        their metadata has come to a good end. The project aims to provide a
                        comprehensive and up-to-date source of information about the cryptocurrency market, and to make
                        this information accessible and usable to a wide audience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To date, the project has made significant progress towards its original goals, requirements, and
                        projected outcome. The following is a summary of the project's current status and progress.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Original goals and requirements: The original goals of the project were to build a modular
                            web system capable of expressing and managing knowledge about existing cryptocurrencies and
                            their metadata. This system was required to use a SPARQL endpoint to perform all data
                            queries and
                            to expose information in multiple formats, including HTML+RDFa and JSON-LD. Additionally,
                            the
                            system was required to provide multiple visualizations of interest.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Current progress: The modular web system is currently functional, with all required
                            services (<b>cryptocurrencies</b> and <b>news</b>)
                            implemented and integrated into a cohesive whole. The
                            system is modular, as both services use their own database.
                            The services are called through the GraphQL API, using multiple queries and
                            mutations like: <i>get cryptocurrency by id</i> query, <i>get cryptocurrencies</i> query,
                            <i>create
                                cryptocurrency</i> mutation, <i>update cryptocurrency</i> mutation, <i>remove
                                cryptocurrency</i> mutation, <i>get
                                news by cryptocurrency id</i> query, <i>get news by id</i> query, <i>create news</i>
                            mutation, <i>update news</i>
                            mutation, <i>delete news</i> mutation. The GraphQL calls are directed to the service
                            responsible of
                            the entity provided in the query or mutation. The services make operations on
                            the database
                            using the SPARQL endpoint which offers fast and reliable access to the stored data.
                            The system is also able to expose
                            information in multiple formats, including HTML+RDFa and JSON-LD, providing users with the
                            ability to
                            access
                            and use the data in the format that best suits their needs. Finally, the system includes
                            multiple visualizations of interest, using charts like pie-chart, bar-chart or time-seriers
                            chart, allowing users to easily understand and
                            analyze the data.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Comparison to initial projections: The project's progress to date is in line with the
                            original
                            projections, with all required functionalities implemented and integrated into a functional
                            system, having the previous designed architecture.
                            There have been some minor deviations from the original plan, like the comparisons of the
                            cryptocurrencies, but these have not impacted
                            the overall progress of the project.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Evaluation of project success: The project has been a success so far, with the modular web
                            system
                            meeting all of its original goals, requirements, and projected outcome. The system is
                            functional
                            and
                            user-friendly, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date source of information about the
                            cryptocurrency market.
                        </li>

                    </ol>

                    In conclusion, the modular web system is on track to meet its original goals, requirements, and
                    projected outcome. The system is functional and user-friendly, providing a comprehensive and
                    up-to-date source of information about the cryptocurrency market.

                <div>
                    <p>The GraphQL API implemented within the application is provided through <a
                            href="https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/">AWS AppSync</a>, a fully managed GraphQL API layer
                        developed by
                        Amazon Web Services. AppSync allows developers to build GraphQL APIs without much of the usual
                        work; it handles
                        the parsing and resolution of requests as well as connecting to other AWS services like AWS
                        Lambda, NoSQL and
                        SQL data stores, and HTTP APIs to gather backend data for the API.</p>
                    <p>As far as the current project is concerned, any call to the API determines the invocation of a
                        lambda function
                        (either the function associated with the cryptocurrencies service, or the function associated
                        with the news
                        service) since each query or mutation is connected to a lambda function data source.</p>
                    <p>The mapping between the lambda function that is called and the operation is the following:</p>

                    <p>This GraphQL API is called by the React application through <a
                            href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/">Apollo Client</a> library. Apollo Client is
                        a comprehensive
                        state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data
                        with GraphQL. Use
                        it to fetch, cache, and modify application data, all while automatically updating your UI.</p>
                    <p>The React application takes full advantage of the features brought by this library. For example,
                        the
                        cryptocurrencies displayed on an accessed page are cached. Therefore, upon subsequent access to
                        the same page,
                        the cryptocurrencies that will be displayed will not be obtained through a call to the API, but
                        will be
                        retrieved from the cache. Another example which is worth mentioning:
                        the library will automatically call the API to get the updated state of the page when a
                        cryptocurrency is
                        deleted from the current page.</p>
